# business-intelligence-project-

Prepared by: Hind Cherrat

# Introduction
This project serves as the culminating assignment for my google business intelligence professional  course, focusing on utilizing SQL and Tableau. Within this case study, I
will simulate the responsibilities of a junior business intelligence professional at Cyclistic, a fictional company.

# Scenario
In this scenario, you are working as a BI professional for a fictional consumer electronics and fitness company, Cyclistic. In order to provide your team with both BI business value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that will demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers.

# Activity 1 : 
In this activity, you will complete the three key business intelligence project documents: the Stakeholder Requirements Document, the Project Requirements Document, and the Strategy Document. To fill out each section, you will use your meeting notes from your meeting with the Cyclistic stakeholders to identify key project requirements and stakeholder asks.

# Activity 2 :
In this activity, you created target tables to consolidate and store the data you pulled from the Cyclistic datasets. These tables will allow you to develop a dashboard using Tableau in the upcoming end-of-course project activities in the next course. As a BI professional, you will need to be able to use programs such as BigQuery and Dataflow to move and analyze data with SQL.

# Activity 3 :
In this activity, you created data visualizations, a low fidelity mockup to help you plan the components and layout of your dashboard, charts to be included in your visualization, and a dashboard for Cyclistic. You also completed an executive summary document that describes to Cyclistic stakeholders the business needs, project goals, dashboard functionality, and your BI methods. As a BI professional, you will need to be able to communicate technical information in a way that all users can understand.
