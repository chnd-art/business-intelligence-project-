# business-intelligence-project-

Prepared by: Hind Cherrat

Introduction
This project serves as the culminating assignment for my google business intelligence professional  course, focusing on utilizing SQL and Tableau. Within this case study, I
will simulate the responsibilities of a junior business intelligence professional at Cyclistic, a fictional company.

Scenario
In this scenario, you are working as a BI professional for a fictional consumer electronics and fitness company, Cyclistic. In order to provide your team with both BI business value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that will demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers.
